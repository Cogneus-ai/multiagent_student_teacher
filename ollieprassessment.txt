 Geometric questions and answers from point,line,angles,triangles and different kinds of theorem in triangles:

       Points and Lines
       What is a point?
         A point represents a location in space and has no dimensions (no length, width, or height).
     What is a line?
         A line is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions with no thickness.
     What is a line segment?
         A line segment is a part of a line that has two endpoints.
     What are parallel lines?
         Parallel lines are lines in a plane that never meet; they are always the same distance apart.
     What are intersecting lines?
         Intersecting lines are lines that cross each other at a single point.

Angles
     What is an angle?
         An angle is formed when two rays meet at a common endpoint, called the vertex.
    What are the different types of angles?
         Acute angle: An angle less than 90°.
         Right angle: An angle exactly 90°.
         Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° but less than 180°.
         Straight angle: An angle exactly 180°.
     What is a complementary angle?
         Two angles are complementary if their sum is 90°.
     What is a supplementary angle?
         Two angles are supplementary if their sum is 180°.

Triangles
     What is a triangle?
         A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.
    What are the different types of triangles by angles?
         Acute triangle: All angles are less than 90°.
         Right triangle: One angle is 90°.
         Obtuse triangle: One angle is greater than 90°.
    What are the different types of triangles by sides?
         Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal.
         Isosceles triangle: two sides are equal.
         Scalene triangle: all sides are unequal.
     What is the Pythagorean Theorem?
        i don't know
     What is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle?
         i don't know
Triangle Theorems
    What is  angle Sum Theore?
         The sum of the angles in a triangle is 90°.
    What is exterior Angle Theorem?
         An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the one opposite interior angles.
